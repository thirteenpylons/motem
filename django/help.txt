using a virtual environment:
	python -m venv 13pyenv(only needed to create the venv)
	
	@Windows
	# be in this directory:(run the cmd /k on activate.bat)
	C:\Users\p2806225\Desktop\Projects\Git\13py\13pyenv\Scripts>cmd /k activate.bat
	
	# starting the project in django(in virtual environment)
	django-admin startproject (name) # named mine myshop
	
	# this will NOT work with my windows build:
	source 13pyenv/scripts/activate (While using bash)
	@deactivate venv:
		deactivate(LOL)
